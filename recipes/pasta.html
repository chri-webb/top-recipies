<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>300-400g (about 10-14 oz) of your preferred generic pasta (e.g., penne, fusilli, spaghetti, rotini)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 x 400g (14 oz) can crushed tomatoes or diced tomatoes</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano (optional)</li>
  <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional, for a little kick)</li>
  <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
  <li>Fresh basil leaves, torn or chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
  <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.</li>
      <li>Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (firm to the bite).</li>
      <li>Before draining, reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
      <li>Pour in the crushed or diced tomatoes. Stir in the dried oregano and red pepper flakes (if using).</li>
      <li>Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
      <li>Season the sauce with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Combine Pasta and Sauce:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the cooked and drained pasta directly to the skillet with the tomato sauce.</li>
      <li>Toss well to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, add a spoonful or two of the reserved pasta cooking water until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
      <li>Cook for another 1-2 minutes, tossing constantly, to allow the pasta to absorb some of the sauce's flavor.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Divide the pasta among serving plates.</li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
      <li>Serve hot, with grated Parmesan cheese on the side for sprinkling, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy your simple and delicious pasta!</p>
