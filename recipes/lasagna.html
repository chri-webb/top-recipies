    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>500g (about 1 lb) ground beef or a mix of beef and pork</li>
  <li>1 x 800g (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
  <li>1 x 400g (14 oz) can tomato passata or pureed tomatoes</li>
  <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
  <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp dried basil (or a few fresh leaves)</li>
  <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
  <li>12-15 lasagna noodles (oven-ready or regular, pre-boiled if necessary)</li>
  <li>500g (about 1 lb) ricotta cheese</li>
  <li>1 large egg</li>
  <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping</li>
  <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, plus more for topping</li>
  <li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>For the Béchamel Sauce:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>50g (3.5 tbsp) unsalted butter</li>
  <li>50g (1/2 cup) all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>600ml (2.5 cups) warm milk</li>
  <li>Pinch of nutmeg</li>
  <li>Salt and white pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add ground beef (or mix) and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
      <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato passata, tomato paste, oregano, and basil. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for at least 30-45 minutes (the longer, the better for flavor development), stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to form a roux.</li>
      <li>Gradually whisk in the warm milk, a little at a time, making sure to whisk out any lumps. Continue whisking until the sauce thickens and is smooth.</li>
      <li>Season with nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Keep warm.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Mix well.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 190°C (375°F). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.</li>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
      <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce (break them if needed to fit). If using regular noodles, ensure they are pre-boiled according to package directions.</li>
      <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
      <li>Spoon about a third of the béchamel sauce over the ricotta.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with a generous layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
      <li>Add another layer of meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, remaining ricotta, béchamel, mozzarella, meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Top with a final layer of noodles, the remaining béchamel sauce, and a generous sprinkling of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bake the Lasagna:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Cover the baking dish loosely with aluminum foil (you might want to spray the underside of the foil with cooking spray to prevent cheese from sticking).</li>
      <li>Bake for 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove the foil and bake for another 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This helps the layers set and makes for easier serving.</li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh chopped parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</p>
